	><p>Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when your smartphone instantly recognizes your pet in a photo or your social media feed displays images similar to what you've liked before?</p>
	 <p>A large part of the magic lies in deep learning architectures. One such architecture is called ResNet-50. ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that excels at image classification. 
	    It's like a highly trained image analyst who can dissect a picture, identify objects and scenes within it, and categorize them accordingly.</p>
     <p>In this blog post, we'll delve into the inner workings of ResNet-50 and explore how it revolutionized the field of image classification and computer vision.</p>
	 <h2 id="what-is-resnet-50">What is ResNet-50?</h2><p>ResNet-50 is CNN architecture that belongs to the ResNet (Residual Networks) family, a series of models designed to address the challenges associated 
	    with training deep neural networks. Developed by researchers at Microsoft Research Asia, ResNet-50 is renowned for its depth and efficiency in image classification tasks. ResNet architectures come in various depths, 
		such as ResNet-18, ResNet-32, and so forth, with ResNet-50 being a mid-sized variant.</p>
	 <p>ResNet-50 was released in 2015, but remains a notable model in the history of image classification.</p><h2 id="resnet-and-residual-blocks">ResNet and Residual Blocks</h2>
	 <p>The primary problem ResNet solved was the degradation problem in deep neural networks. As networks become deeper, their accuracy saturates and then degrades rapidly. This degradation is not caused by overfitting, but rather the difficulty of optimizing the training process.</p>

This block it has the following architecture:<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/04/image-177.webp" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="264" height="241"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Bottleneck Residual Block for ResNet-50/101/152. </em></i><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u><i><em class="italic underline" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Source</em></i></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>Here's a breakdown of the components within the residual block:</p><p><strong>ReLU Activation</strong>: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied after each convolutional layer and the batch normalization layers. ReLU allows only positive values to pass through, introducing non-linearity into the network, which is essential for the network to learn complex patterns in the data.</p><p><strong>Bottleneck Convolution Layers</strong>: the block consists of three convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation after each.:</p><ul><li>The first convolutional layer likely uses a filter size of 1x1 and reduces the number of channels in the input data. This dimensionality reduction helps to compress the data and improve computational efficiency without sacrificing too much information.</li><li>The second convolutional layer might use a filter size of 3x3 to extract spatial features from the data.</li><li>The third convolutional layer again uses a filter size of 1x1 to restore the original number of channels before the output is added to the shortcut connection.</li></ul><p><strong>Skip Connection</strong>: As in a standard residual block, the key element is the shortcut connection. It allows the unaltered input to be added directly to the output of the convolutional layers. This bypass connection ensures that essential information from earlier layers is preserved and propagated through the network, even if the convolutional layers struggle to learn additional features in that specific block.</p><p>By combining convolutional layers for feature extraction with shortcut connections that preserve information flow, and introducing a bottleneck layer to reduce dimensionality, bottleneck residual blocks enable ResNet-50 to effectively address the vanishing gradient problem, train deeper networks, and achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.</p><h2 id="stacking-the-blocks-building-resnet-50">Stacking the Blocks: Building ResNet-50</h2><p>ResNet-50 incorporates 50 bottleneck residual blocks, arranged in a stacked manner. The early layers of the network feature conventional convolutional and pooling layers to preprocess the image before it undergoes further processing by the residual blocks. Ultimately, fully connected layers positioned at the pinnacle of the structure utilize the refined data to categorize the image with precision.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/04/image-182.webp" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="936" height="418" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-182.webp 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/04/image-182.webp 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ResNet Architectures.
